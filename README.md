# login-auth
A simple and quick login-authentication process.

## Basic Version
Connects to remote db.
User types in username and password to authentication page, sends you to a different page once authenticated.
If authentication fails, user is prompted to try again. 

## Possible Addendums
Ability to sign up via e-mail, maybe even using Google. 
Can reset password via sending e-mail.
Add 2FA as an option.

## Tech
 - Heroku for remote database connection (likely in PostgreSQL but might use something I'm less familiar with)
 - Python backend, likely Flask.
 - Simple frontend, likely a combination of JS + Bootstrap + HTML templating.

## Reason For This Project
I'd like to mess around with Python a little bit while staying within my comfort zone.
